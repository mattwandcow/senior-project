## Database System for Predicting User Engagement via Interest Profiles

My Senior Project was a database system that provided a proof of concept system for a content review and recomendation system that sorted users into various "wavelengths" based on the reviews they provided, grouping users with like interests, and modifiying the returned content recommendations based on how the system calculated that their wavelength would appreciate the specific content.

Since posting the project, the hosting service, Heroku, changed their systems, removing free access for small accounts, and the database information was lost, as was the hosted website. 

Framework: NodeJS
Database: Postgres

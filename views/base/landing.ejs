				<h2>How to use this site</h2>
				<p>Any visitor to the site can click on <a href="/recommendations">Recommendations</a> and get a list of
				content items that have a high like ratio from the general reviews of all members of the site. Creating a
				user account and logging in enables you to rate content items, which places you in a wavelength. Recommendations
				then may review more targeted results, provided there are enough people on your wavelength to provide useful
				recomendations.
				Search can be useful in finding a specific content item, and clicking on the title of a content item brings you to
				a page with more information on that individual content piece. If you are logged in, the option to see your profile
				will show what you've rated so far.
